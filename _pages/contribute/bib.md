The [caribank bibliography](/meta/bib/) contains most relevant sources on Cariban languages.
Every work has a unique identifier, a so-called bibkey, visible in the [sources.bib](https://github.com/caribank/meta/blob/main/bib/sources.bib) file.
Works can be referenced using the notation `bibkey[pages]` or simply `bibkey` if there are no pages.
For instance, `alves2019arara[19]` means 'Alves (2019: 19)'.

Anything sourced from the literature (attested forms, cognate set, reconstruction, cognacy, etc.) should receive an appropriate annotation in the `Source` column.

For the moment, the way to add missing works to the bibliography is to [open an issue](https://github.com/caribank/meta/issues/new).
