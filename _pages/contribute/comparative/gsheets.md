There is a shared [spreadsheet on Google docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/152RxIXQCZjkylyLuho0co69ySU_cgZ1z9xwtDmeYDjQ/edit#gid=137007560), where each tab is synced with a CSV file.
To work on Google sheets, [contact us](mailto:caribanresources@gmail.com) to get an invitation.
Read the [general annotation guidelines](/contribute/comparative) for instructions how to annotate.
The spreadsheet also contains an overview of the tables.
