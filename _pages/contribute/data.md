If you have data of a Cariban language which is not yet in the database, and would like to share it, please [contact us](mailto:caribanresources@gmail.com).
You will be listed as an author of the full dataset.
If you would like, we can also create a standalone, citable, reusable version of your dataset.

We can offer conversion to CLDF for the following formats:
* anything wordlist- or dictionary-like (plain text/spreadsheet)
* Shoebox/Toolbox
* FLEx

If your data is in some other format, there is a good chance that we can make it work.
