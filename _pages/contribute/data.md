If you have data of a Cariban language which is not yet in the database and would like to share it, please [contact us](mailto:caribanresources@gmail.com).
We would be delighted to make your data accessible.
Of course, contributing primary data makes you an important co-author of the entire dataset.
If desired, we can also create a standalone, citable version of your dataset.

We can offer conversion to CLDF for the following formats:
* anything wordlist- or dictionary-like (plain text/spreadsheet/...)
* Shoebox/Toolbox projects
* FLEx projects

If your data is in some other format, there is a good chance that we can make it work, too.
