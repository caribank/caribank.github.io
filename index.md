Caribank is a project bringing together corpus and lexical data from all [Cariban](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/cari1283) languages.
The data is aggregated from a [collection of individual datasets](datasets) and can be used for corpus studies or comparative purposes.
Currently, the bulk of Caribank is made up by SÃ©rgio Meira's [shoebox](https://software.sil.org/shoebox/) databases, a product of many years' work.
Florian Matter derived [CLDF](https://cldf.clld.org/) datasets from these databases and started adding other datasets.
