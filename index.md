Caribank is a project bringing together data from all [Cariban](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/cari1283) languages, with the goal of facilitating the comparison and reconstruction of Cariban lexicon.
It is compiled from a collection of individual [CLDF](https://cldf.clld.org/) datasets.

The bulk of the data contained in caribank was compiled and glossed in [shoebox](https://software.sil.org/shoebox/) by SÃ©rgio Meira over many years.
Florian Matter converted these shoebox files to CLDF datasets and started adding other datasets.
